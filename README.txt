CISC190 - Lab 5
Author: Alessandro Greco

This lab contains three programs:

1. FallingDistance.java
   - Asks the user for a number of seconds.
   - Prints a table of time vs. distance in free fall.
   - Uses a separate method getDistance(int seconds).

2. Prime.java
   - Asks the user for a number greater than 2.
   - Tests if the number is prime using testForPrime(int).
   - Repeats until the user types "no".

3. Grades.java
   - Asks the user for input and output filenames.
   - Reads lines of grades ending with -1.
   - Counts letter grades (Aâ€“F), computes min, max, and average.
   - Writes the results into the output file.
   - If a line only contains -1, writes "No grades to average".

Files included:
- FallingDistance.java
- Prime.java
- Grades.java
- Example input file: grades.txt
- Example output file: results.txt
